# YouTube Timestamp Scroller

> Browser extension to scroll back to a YouTube comment after watching its timestamp

## How it works

Do you ever find yourself in this situation?

1. Check the comments of a YouTube video
2. Find a comment with a timestamp
3. Click the timestamp
4. Watch part of the video from that timestamp
5. **Scroll back down to the original comment**
6. Repeat

What if the step #5 above could be automated?

With this extension, when you click a timestamp, YouTube will play the video from that point. The next time you pause the video you will be redirected back down to the original comment automatically.
